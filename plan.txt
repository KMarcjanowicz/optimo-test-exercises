Room renovation plan.
1.Pre-renovation preparations
    - take the furniture out of the room and store it in the house's corridors
    - cover it with the cover film, for it to not catch any dust
    - stash the carpet in the cellar
    - purchase the required products for the renovation: paint, brushes, new flooring
2.Renovation of the room
    - tape the edges of the walls with painter's tape, not to overspill any tape
